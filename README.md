# HDL-Based_Hardware_Testing
A sample problem using verilog for hardware testing

Tasks:
(a) Create a structural style module for the logic circuit.
(b) Find a set of test vectors for detecting a stuck-at-0 fault at the input of the gate X.
(c) Create a self-checking testbench for the stuck-at-0 fault of the module.
(d) Verify that the testbench is functional by using force command for the input of the
gate X.
